# will be named by reversing their path back to World, so

# `score.sh-cave-forest`, and `/World/cottage/__pta_resources/00-score.sh` will 
# be linked by a file named `00-score.sh-cottage`. This will allow for ordering 
# the scoring scripts by naming them with numbers. These scripts will be sourced 
# by the `score` command, in that order.
